# Rehearsal Tracker
Rehearsal Tracker is a project that was submitted as part of an immersive coding certification program at Prime Academy in Minneapolis, MN. It was born out of my past experiences as a member of arts organizations where rehearsal information could sometimes be hard to access because it was typically posted in hard copy form somewhere on a call board that was physically located in the rehearsal space. I came up with this application for stage management staff to be able to schedule rehearsals and notify all rehearsal participants via email with the click of a button.   


# Set up
1. Create a database named rehearsal_tracker.
2. Run the queries that are stored in the database.sql file to populate the tables and insert the values you'll need. Postgres will need to be installed and Postico is recommneded as a GUI to intereact with the DB.      
3. Run npm install in your terminal
4. npm run server / npm run client to launch the application.
